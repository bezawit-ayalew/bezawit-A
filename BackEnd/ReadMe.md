# Full-Stack MERN Application - Backend Implementation

## Description

For this assignment, I implemented the backend of a full-stack MERN application. This involved setting up routing to handle incoming requests, creating controllers for high-level data access, and implementing data access objects (DAOs) for querying the database directly.

# MERN Stack Application

## Overview

This is the first assignment in the MERN stack application project. In this assignment, I set up the backend environment for the application, including the installation of necessary dependencies, setting up the project structure, and configuring MongoDB.

## What We Have Done

1. **Created Project Directory and Initialized Git Repository**
   - Set up the main project directory with `backend` and `frontend` subdirectories.
   - Initialized a Git repository in the `backend` directory.

2. **Installed NVM and Node.js**
   - Installed Node Version Manager (NVM) to manage Node.js versions.
   - Installed Node.js version 18.15.0 using NVM.

3. **Set Up the Backend Project**
   - Initialized a Node.js project with `npm init`.
   - Installed Yarn package manager globally.
   - Installed project dependencies using Yarn: `express`, `cors`, `dotenv`, and `mongodb`.
   - Created necessary files and directories for the backend project.
   - Added `.gitignore` file to exclude `node_modules` and `.env` from version control.
   - Made the initial commit to the Git repository.

4. **Installed and Configured MongoDB**
   - Installed MongoDB Community Edition.
   - Installed MongoDB Compass for a GUI client.
   - Restored the `movie_time_db` database using `mongorestore`.
   - Created an empty `reviews` collection in the `movie_time_db` database using MongoDB Compass.
