# Welcome to my Data Sciecne Projects

### 1. Amazon Products Sentiment Analysis 
● Goal: To enhance Amazon's e-commerce platform using sentiment analysis to gauge customer feedback

● Method: Utilized Python, Pandas, and TensorFlow to build Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression,
LSTM, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to
analyze sentiments of customers
● Outcome: An LSTM model achieved 90% accuracy in sentiment analysis, aiding Amazon in identifying customer
sentiments accurately
### 2. Optimizing Sports Performance: Jockey Data Feature Engineering
● Goal: To identify and analyze the most influential features (track information and jockey data) that determine the likelihood of a jockey winning a race and improving jockey winning odds
● Method: Built K-means, isolation forest, linear regression models, and PCA to analyze features, and evaluated clusters’ accuracy using ARI, Silhouette, and Inertia scores
● Outcome: Identified the most influential variable(weight of a jockey) affecting the odds of winning
### 3. Analyzing Social Media Sentiments Post Roe v. Wade 
● Goal: To explore the spectrum of opinions expressed on Twitter following significant legal events related to reproductive rights, such as the overturn of Roe v. Wade
● Method: Utilized a combination of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), and deep learning models for sentiment analysis
● Outcome: A real-time user interface capable of accurately analyzing the sentiment of text at 90% accuracy, providing insights into the diverse range of opinions expressed in Twitter discourse.
### 4. Housing Market Data Analysis using R Programming 
● Goal: Develop a measure of "untruthfulness" in a Craigslist housing dataset to detect potentially fraudulent listings, focusing on low prices or square footage, aiming to enhance community awareness and inform scam prevention policies
● Method: Utilized R programming to clean a dataset of 300,000 rows, and implemented a binary variable 'Untruthful' at the listing level based on specific criteria like missing values or extreme price/area_sqft. Aggregated measures at the census tract level to pinpoint potential scam hotspots
● Outcome: Successfully constructed a latent measure of 'untruthfulness' to assess scam likelihood in housing listings. Analyze correlations and regressions to understand factors influencing housing prices and scam prevalence, informing targeted interventions for scam prevention
### 5. Predicting Undernutrition Among Under-five Children
● Goal: To identify the most influential features(e.g household wealth index) that influenced undernutrition among under-five children in Ethiopia to help policymakers achieve targeted interventions
● Method: Built Random Forest, MLP, and Naive Bayes models to rank over 300,000+ features from the dataset
● Outcome: 'Time To Water' is the most significant factor influencing undernutrition
